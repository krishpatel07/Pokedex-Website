# Pokemon Trading Cards - POKEDEX ⚡

## 🧾 Abstract:

This project presents a full-stack Pokedex application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, designed to provide users with an interactive platform to explore, manage, and interact with a database of Pokémon. The application offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to add new Pokémon entries, view detailed information, update existing data, and delete records as needed. The front-end is developed using React for a responsive and dynamic user interface, while the back-end is powered by Node.js and Express.js for efficient API handling. MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database for storing Pokémon data. This project emphasizes modular design, RESTful API communication, and user-friendly UI/UX to simulate a real-world web application development environment. The Pokedex aims to enhance understanding of full-stack development principles while delivering an engaging experience for users and developers alike.
